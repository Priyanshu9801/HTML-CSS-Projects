# HTML & CSS Projects

A collection of mini projects built to strengthen my fundamentals in **HTML** and **CSS** through hands-on practice.

### 📌 Projects Included

* **Interactive Shapes Game**
  A visual game featuring a square, diamond, and circle, where each shape displays a unique color when hovered over.

* **Hover-Based Card Reveal Game**
  A stack of four overlapping cards in which the card under the cursor becomes visible on hover.

* **Unacademy Website UI (Single Page)**
  A single-page UI clone inspired by the Unacademy website, focusing on layout, styling, and responsiveness.

These projects helped me gain practical experience with **layouts, hover effects, positioning, and basic UI design** using only HTML and CSS.
